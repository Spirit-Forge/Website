                <p>In the time before time, the Great Beings unraveled the mysteries of their world, bringing forth spirits of the elements with powers beyond belief.</p>
                <p hidden>Today, a trio of brave Toa has returned to the place of their creation, unlocking the wonders of the Spirit Forge once more…</p>

            <p>Everyone on the Mask of Destiny team is proud to present the <strong>Spirit Forge</strong>, an online repository of BIONICLE resources, as well as all the information you need to design and build your own custom sets.</p>
            <p>BIONICLE may have been discontinued by LEGO, but through the endless creativity of its fans, as well as the increasing accessibility of technologies like 3D printing, the legend lives on to this day.</p>

            <p>Designing BIONICLE sets has never been easier thanks to BrickLink’s <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/download.page">Studio</a> program. To get started, just click “Download Studio 2.0.”</p>
            <p>Studio comes with many BIONICLE pieces by default, as well as a few Kanohi masks — however, you’ll likely want more, which is where custom part packs come into play. Luckily, the BIONICLE community has produced several, which are compiled here.</p>
