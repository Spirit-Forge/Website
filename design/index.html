        <p>Designing BIONICLE sets has never been easier thanks to BrickLink’s <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/download.page">Studio</a> program. To get started, just click “Download Studio 2.0.”</p>
        <p>Studio comes with many BIONICLE pieces by default, as well as a few Kanohi masks — however, you’ll likely want more, which is where custom part packs come into play. Luckily, the BIONICLE community has produced several, which are compiled here.</p>
